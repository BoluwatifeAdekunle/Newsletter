📝 Solution Retrospective
What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?
I’m proud of the clean, responsive layout that works across all devices. Next time, I’d integrate a live validation script and connect it to a real backend service for email storage.

What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?
Keeping the design centered and consistent across devices was tricky at first, but Flexbox made it straightforward. I also refined spacing for better mobile readability.

What specific areas of your project would you like help with?
Suggestions for improving the form’s accessibility and adding subtle animations without overcomplicating the design.
